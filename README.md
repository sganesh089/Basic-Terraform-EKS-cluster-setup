# Basic-Terraform-EKS-cluster-setup

This is a basic setup for creating and deploying EKS cluster using terraform.
Used a T2 medium aws ubuntu instance for this project. Initially tried t2 micro instance but it crashed due to low configration i think so! While trying to view the terraform plan the t2 micro instance froze and went into unresponsive mode.
Pre-requistes for this project is a AWS instance with admin configs, AWS cli, Terraform, kubectl installed.
